        <h2>Erice </h2>
        <p>The main town of Erice is located on top of Mount Erice, at around 750 metres (2,460 ft) above sea level, overlooking
          the city of Trapani, the low western coast towards Marsala, the dramatic Punta del Saraceno and Capo San Vito to the
          north-east, and the Aegadian Islands on Sicily's north-western coast. Casa Santa forms part of Erice at the base of
          Mount Erice, immediately adjacent to Trapani. A cable car joins the upper and lower parts of Erice.

          <h2>Sentiero Monte Monaco </h2>
          <p>Mount Monaco is situated at the northern tip of the headland of San Vito Lo Capo, the seaside town known for its
            crystal-clear waters and for its long white sandy beach. There are three loop waymarked routes (of great natural,
            historical and cultural interest)..</p>
          <p>
            Starting from the western side of the mountain, walkers run through a historical path used by the locals to reach
            their fields. The Mondello municipal road, immediately behind San Vito Lo Capo, leads easily to the top of the
            mountain. Along the path, very well signed, the typical Mediterranean vegetation, characterised by dwarf palms,
            and small wooded areas can be seen. Although the vegetation is rather sparse there are several plant species
            (also endemic) that bloom throughout the year.</p>

          <h2>Alcantara River Park</h2>
          <p>The Alcantara River Park is an interesting attraction approximately 15 minutes away from Giardini Naxos. It
            is famous for the gorges within the park, which have corroded the rock through geological phenomena. All this
            took place when, a long time ago, a small volcano erupted and spurted out a mass of lava which formed a huge
            crack. In an area with dense clay, the lava sunk and formed two large black columns of basalt 50 meters high.
            The Alcantara River now flows between this crack. A visit to the Gole dell’Alcantara, and walking along the
            small stretch of river bed is a truly unique experience. However, it can only be done from May to September
            when the water level lowers. The sight is amazing. The freezing waters, gorges, dark and brilliant geological
            structures, all create wonderful reflections of light and shadows as soon as the sun hits the surface</p>

          <h2>Table and list example</h2>
          <p>

            The <span class="tag">tabel</span> tag defines an HTML table.

            Each table row is defined with a <span class="tag">tr</span> tag. Each table header is defined with a
            <span class="tag">th</span> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <span class="tag">td</span> tag.

            By default, the text in <span class="tag">th</span> elements are bold and centered.

            By default, the text in <span class="tag">td</span> elements are regular and left-aligned.
