    <h2>Sentiero Monte Monaco </h2>
    <p>Mount Monaco is situated at the northern tip of the headland of San Vito Lo Capo, the seaside town known for its
      crystal-clear waters and for its long white sandy beach. There are three loop waymarked routes (of great natural,
      historical and cultural interest)..</p>
    <p>
      Starting from the western side of the mountain, walkers run through a historical path used by the locals to reach
      their fields. The Mondello municipal road, immediately behind San Vito Lo Capo, leads easily to the top of the
      mountain. Along the path, very well signed, the typical Mediterranean vegetation, characterised by dwarf palms,
      and small wooded areas can be seen. Although the vegetation is rather sparse there are several plant species
      (also endemic) that bloom throughout the year.

      Nearby the top of the mountain there are the remains of an old quarry, nowadays abandoned, where a kind of a
      compact limestone, with a peculiar red-brown colour dating back to the Jurassic era, was quarried. The quarries
      of Rosso San Vito (or Contorrana), situated in this area, supplied one of the most appreciated red stones of the
      Baroque in Sicily. Past the quarries, hikers will start to see a big cross indicating the point of arrival. Beside
      it is a small niche where a diary, in which it is possible to leave a comment, is kept.

      At the top, at an altitude of 530 meters, walkers can enjoy a breathtaking view: on the south western side it
      ranges from Erice to Mount Cofano, on the eastern side there are the Gulf of Castellammare and the mountains
      overlooking Palermo, on the southern side a view ranging from Mount Speziale to Mount Sparagio, and to the north
      the Tyrrhenian Sea.
      The descent is on the opposite side, following the dirt road situated on the upper part of the path.

      Thence to Cala Firriato, where it’s easy to meet climbers training on the low rocky walls, suspended over the
      water. Following this route it takes about one hour and half to get to San Vito Lo Capo.

      The path is easy and suitable also for children. Comfortable shoes are recommended, as well as a bathing suit
      and a towel: you cannot resist the temptation to dive into these crystal clear waters!</p>
