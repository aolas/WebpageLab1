    <h2>Erice </h2>
    <p>The main town of Erice is located on top of Mount Erice, at around 750 metres (2,460 ft) above sea level, overlooking
      the city of Trapani, the low western coast towards Marsala, the dramatic Punta del Saraceno and Capo San Vito to the
      north-east, and the Aegadian Islands on Sicily's north-western coast. Casa Santa forms part of Erice at the base of
      Mount Erice, immediately adjacent to Trapani. A cable car joins the upper and lower parts of Erice.</p>
    <p>
      The bordering municipalities are Buseto Palizzolo, Paceco, Trapani, Valderice and Custonaci.
      The hamlets (frazioni) are Ballata, Casa Santa, Crocefissello, Napola, Pizzolungo, Rigaletta, San Cusumano and Torretta
      In the northeastern portion of the city there are the remains of ancient Elymian and Phoenician walls (Cyclopean masonry)
      indicating different stages of settlement and occupation in antiquity.
      There are two castles that remain in the city: Pepoli Castle, which dates from Saracen times, and the Castello di Venere ("Venus Castle"),
      dating from the Norman period, built on top of the ancient Temple of Venus, where Venus Ericina was worshipped. According to legend, the
      temple was founded by Aeneas. It was well known throughout the Mediterranean area in the ancient age, and an important cult was celebrated
      in it. In his book On the Nature of Animals, Aelian writes that animals chosen for sacrifice would voluntarily walk up to the altar to be killed.
      A cable car (funivia) ran from 2005 to 2017, when it was closed due to a forest fire, from the outskirts of Trapani to the town of Erice.
      The cablecar was rebuilt and reopened in June 2018.
